 ## Technical Challenages

 This is my very first full stack application that I've ever build. I had no prior knowledge to any of the technology that was covered in this bootcamp, so I have had alot of challenges along the way.
 
 1. Security
     - I was having trouble with after registering, in the UserService  it wasnt saving the user to the authority table so that it can authenticate. 
 2. ThymeLeaf
     - There was times where thymeleaf needed and sometime it didnt, and knowing when it does and doesnt was hard.

 ## Lesson Learned
 
 I have learned so much doing this project. Honestly, if you ask me to make an application three months ago, I wouldnt even know how or where to start. This training taught me alot and I am so excited to build more applications and to make things more interactive.
